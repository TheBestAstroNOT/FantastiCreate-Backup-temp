# FantastiCreate
A fabric modpack with 550+ mods, focused on optimized featurefulness, realism without tediousness, progression without overgrinding, exploring and boss-hunting, and building the greatest bases using the Create mod, among many other things.

I always got quickly bored when playing Minecraft. Exhaustion from grinding enchantments, and the lack of objective afterwards. It felt empty.
Soon after that, I tried to make my own modpack, so that it would be fun again. It started with only a few mods, but it quickly ramped up to the 550+ mods that there are today.
This is my vision of a perfect modded Minecraft. If you like vanilla Minecraft, you won't probably like this, and viceversa.


For anything related to the modpack, you can go to our (Discord server)[https://discord.gg/Aj84NyN9], or just directly message me (akai_hana).
Ty to TheBestAstroNOT for all the help. This repo probably wouldn't exist without him.
